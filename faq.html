          <h3 class="faq-question">Does it really work? And if it does, how?</h3>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Homeopathy was founded by German physician Dr. Samuel Hahnemann in 1796. Homeopathy is an alternative system of medicine based on the principle of "Similia Similibus Curentur" which means "Like cures Like." It means substances which can cause symptoms in a healthy individual can cure similar symptoms in a diseased individual.</p>
            <p>Homeopathy is an individualistically oriented science. No two patients get the same remedy even though they are suffering from the same disease.</p>
            <p>Homeopathy is a Natural, Safe and Effective treatment for all stages of life—from 1 day old newborns to elderly people. Homeopathy is also safe for pregnant and breastfeeding women.</p>
            <p>Homeopathic medicines are prepared from Plants, animals or Minerals. They are mostly in the form of small sugar pellets or tablets. They can also be in the form of ointments, tinctures or creams.</p>
            <p>Homeopathic medicines are Natural, Safe and free from any side effects. They stimulate the body's natural defence mechanism and accelerate the healing process.</p>
            <p>Homeopathic medicines also cure the constitutional tendencies of the patient and thus bring about permanent cure.</p>
            <p>Homeopathy is used to treat acute conditions as well as chronic conditions ranging from cold, cough, allergies, asthma, fever, headache, diarrhea, migraines, toothache, injuries, skin diseases, menstrual disorders, thyroid disorders, arthritis, sciatica, menopausal complaints, PCOD, fibroids, and more.</p>
            <p>Homeopathy acts as a supportive and palliative treatment in some diseases like cancer.</p>

          <h3 class="faq-question">Can I take homeopathy medicines while on allopathy treatment?</h3>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>In today's world when the patient is already taking many allopathic medicines for diabetes, blood pressure, heart problems; homeopathy and allopathy should/can work hand in hand. The aim of such treatment is to gradually get rid of the need to take medicine, step by step.</p>

          <h3 class="faq-question">The dosage is so small, how can it work?</h3>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>It is the same as asking how can a small atom cause an atomic blast, or how can a small spark cause a wildfire. The human body is capable of fighting diseases on its own. What is needed is the right trigger for it to work. The skill of the homeopathy practitioner is to provide the correct spark, in correct intensities and in correct dosage.</p>

          <h3 class="faq-question">Sometimes I am advised not to take medicine for weeks and still get cured, how?</h3>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>The human body is a highly sophisticated machine. Even though it is capable of healing itself, it needs time. No one likes constant hammering, even our body. Frequently administering medicines all the time can interfere in the healing process and sometimes can even stop it. The practitioner decides, case by case basis and based upon progress, when and how much medicine to give next, and that's where experience comes handy.</p>

          <h3 class="faq-question">I came to you with 2 different complaints and for both you gave the same medicine. Is that correct?</h3>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Yes, it is possible in some cases (e.g., chronic problems). In Homeopathy we treat a person as a whole and not in parts. It is called a constitutional approach to treatment. The same drug can cover all of a person's different complaints. A practitioner thoroughly understands a person/situation and based on that decides when to follow what approach.</p>

          <h3 class="faq-question">As homeopathic medicines are small sweet pills, can they be consumed by diabetic patients?</h3>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Absolutely yes. Unlike other diseases, diabetes is not trigger-based. It purely depends upon the amount of sugar intake in the body. Even though homeopathic medicines are sweet, they are taken in very small quantities. The tiny globules are made up of lactose and not glucose. On average, the total amount of sugar intake in a week is not more than 1 teaspoon. The negligible amount of sugar in homeopathic pills makes them consumable for diabetics. Homeopathic medicines can also be taken in water. Hence it is absolutely safe for diabetic patients. In fact, diabetes itself can be cured by homeopathic medicines.</p>

          <h3 class="faq-question">Does homeopathic medicine cause tooth decay in children since it is sweet?</h3>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Certainly not! Tooth decay is caused by plaque and sugar deposits on the tooth. It depends upon the amount of sugar intake (of course along with cleaning habits). Even though homeopathic medicines are sweet, they are taken in very small quantities. They are also composed of lactose (not glucose) and on average, the total amount of sugar intake in a week is not more than 1 teaspoon. Hence it is safe for children. In fact, some toothaches can be treated by homeopathic medicines.</p>

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>No, Homeopathy itself is an independent holistic medicinal system. While some homeopathic medicines are prepared from plants, homeopathy is not a branch of any other system of medicine.</p>

            <p>The white pills are only the medium for dispensing medicine to the patient. The liquid is actually the medicine. The tiny white globules don't have any medicinal property themselves.</p>

          <h3 class="faq-question">Homeopathic medicines are slow to act.</h3>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>This is a common myth, but it is not always true. It differs from patient to patient. Most people suffering from long-term chronic diseases come to a homeopath after taking many medications and steroids for years, often as a last option. In such cases with lots of suppression and treatments already taken, it becomes difficult. The immune system is already compromised due to long-term medication use. In such cases, it takes a bit more time. However, homeopathic medicines can act in just a few minutes in many cases.</p>
