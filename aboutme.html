        <p style="line-height: 1.8; color: var(--color-text);">
          After completing my Bachelor's in Homeopathy Medicine—a 5.5-year program at North Gujarat University in Vadodara, India—I began my career with an internship under an experienced doctor, where I gained hands-on experience in case-taking, follow-ups, and prescription management.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.8; color: var(--color-text);">
          Following my internship, I opened my own clinic in Vadodara, running it for a year before relocating to Pune, where I continued to serve the community as a trusted family doctor. Over the years, I have successfully treated a wide range of acute and chronic conditions, including eczema, asthma, arthritis, allergies, autoimmune disorders, behavioral challenges in children, and psychiatric issues, using holistic homeopathic remedies.
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.8; color: var(--color-text);">
          In 2017, I moved to the Netherlands, where I validated my diploma with Nuffic, registered with CAT and NVKH, and attained an A2 Dutch language diploma, progressing to B1-level classes. I also registered my practice with the Chamber of Commerce (KvK).
